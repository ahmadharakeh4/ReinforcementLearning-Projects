Implemented Projects

1. Multi-Armed Bandit Problem

Implementation of the Îµ-greedy, UCB, and Thompson Sampling strategies.

Simulates a casino-style problem where an agent selects from multiple slot machines to maximize rewards.

Analyzes the exploration-exploitation trade-off.

2. Value and Policy Iteration (Grid World)

Solves a Markov Decision Process (MDP) using Dynamic Programming methods.

Implements both value iteration and policy iteration techniques.

Demonstrates optimal policy computation in a simple grid world environment.

3. SARSA Algorithm (Cliff Walking Student)

Implements the SARSA (State-Action-Reward-State-Action) algorithm.

Applied to the Cliff Walking problem where an agent learns to navigate safely.

Compares on-policy learning with Q-learning.

4. Q-Learning (Cliff Walking Student)

Implements the Q-learning algorithm, an off-policy learning technique.

Evaluates the agent's ability to learn the optimal policy through trial and error.

Highlights differences between SARSA and Q-learning in reinforcement learning.
